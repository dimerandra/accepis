\section{Introduction}

	\paragraph{Definition of epiphytism}
	Speaking of terrestrial vascular epiphytes, one can argue that the term is not yet sufficiently defined. Many authors give a very broad definition of epiphytism as plants growing non-parasitically on other plants \parencite[e.g.][]{Zotz2016, Burns2010, Benzing2012, Brown1948, Schimper1903}. Moreover, many authors have claimed that epiphytism is not a phenomenon isolated from plants which grow on the ground but rather a spectrum with many mixed forms \parencite[e.g.][]{Zotz2016}. Accordingly, species with only a few epiphytic individuals are not to be considered epiphytic species but accidental. To clarify this gradient of epiphytism, some authors introduced a classification into obligate, facultative or accidental epiphytes \parencite{Ibisch1996, Benzing2004}. 
	
	\textcite{Zotz2003} drew the attention to the fact, that understanding accidental epiphytism is vital to understand epiphytism itself. In detail, this contains the questions for the necessary conditions for epiphytic individuals. Which factors enable some terrestrial plants to live accidentally as epiphytes? And which hinder most of terrestrial plants not to? Moreover, when the environmental conditions are met for single accidentally epiphytic individuals, then which conditions enable some species to live mostly or exclusively as epiphytes? Apparently, the various climatic conditions of the north-temperate zone did not facilitate many obligate epiphytic taxa.
	
	Based on the quantitative composition of the respective species, \textcite{Ibisch1996} classified species dependent on the proportion of individuals living arboreally. With up to \prc{5} epiphytical individuals, species are considered accidental and with more than \prc{95} obligate, respectively. All species not fitting these two groups, are categorized as facultative which are equally well able to live on the ground and epiphytically  \parencite{Ibisch1996}. However, this classification is only a theoretical consideration and \textcite{Burns2010} argued that this method would be arbitrary for different populations of species spanning various locations. Therefore, they proposed that a species is facultatively epiphytic if its arboreal population is predicted by its population on the forest floor \parencite{Burns2010}. Following that, species would be accidental if they occur more frequently than expected on the ground and obligate if more frequently on trees, respectively.
	
	\paragraph{Accidental epiphytes in detail}
	One explanation for the occurrences of accidental epiphytes is usually a quantitative effect \cim. For example, \textcite{Burns2010} argued that terrestrial individuals of obligate epiphytes may constitute a sink population. A larger input of seeds should increase the chances for germination and later seedling establishment.  Accordingly, epiphytic individuals of very abundant north-temperate species could be the result of a continuous input of their propagules. And common species on the ground should provide comparatively more epiphytical individuals than rarer species. A second factor could be the mode of propagation where the epiphytic location should favor species with propagules most suited for distribution on trees. 
	
	Regarding the global distribution of vascular epiphytes, there are distinctively less epiphytes in the temperate zone than in the tropics. While they comprise a large percentage of the ecosystem diversity in the tropics, epiphytes only have a nearly irrelevant share of this in the temperate zone \parencite{Zotz2005}. Therefore, epiphytism may be a selective threshold \imp{what do you even mean with this?}. Even though accidental epiphytes in the temperate zones have been evaluated not to be meant to grow on other plants, there is hardly any quantitative background to this hypothesis yet. With this in mind, the question is in how far these so-called accidentally epiphytical individuals are really just accidents or a expectable variable. \textcite{Zotz2013} gave some examples of ambiguous cases of epiphytism, where the ratio of epiphytes within the species changes largely between populations. However, these cases differ from most species in the north-temperate zone, since the accidental epiphytes are mostly from species never observed to be epiphytical. \imp{Write this in a better way!}. Accordingly, \textcite{Zotz2013} defined accidental epiphytes as species which only occur rarely epiphytically and which seldom blossom or bear fruits.
	
	Due to their distinctiveness, this study focuses on the accidental epiphytes of the temperate zones. However, as described by \textcite{Schimper1888} as well as by \textcite{Gentry1987a}, both temperate hemispheres differ in their abundance and the type of epiphytes. Some species rich spots in the south like New Zealand and the southern Himalayan Mountains are quite exceptional \parencite[see ZotzBibliography]{Schimper1888, Hofstede2001}. Furthermore, \textcite{Burns2010} argued that the composition of epiphytes is different for both temperate hemispheres. While the southern consists more of obligate epiphytes, the north mostly comprises facultative epiphytes near the floor. Regarding the study's location, this work therefore mainly focuses on epiphytes of the north-temperate hemisphere with a limited validity for the south.
	
	\crr{Should I discuss the limits of epiphytes, such as frost or drought?! If so, see Zotz' Bibliography... There he also discusses prevalence of conifers, which hinder epiphytes (but does not give any references for that). However, what the sheer existence and fruiting \cim shows is that the north-temperate environment cannot be that hostile.}
	
	\paragraph{Records of north-temperate epiphytes}
	As \textcite{Zotz2003} summarized, many studies on accidental epiphytes in the north-temperate zone (mainly Europe) were already published a hundred years ago  (e.g. \cite{Schimper1888, Beyle1903, Beyer1896, Staeger1908, Staeger1912,Magnin1895,Loew1892}; see \textcite{Zotz2003a} for a full bibliography). However, since most of them are in an anecdotal form, these studies can only describe common accidentally epiphytic species but neither their importance nor their sheer numbers. From these early authors, especially \textcite{Staeger1908} conducted a larger work on epiphytism comparing the species composition of two valleys in the Swiss Alps.
	
	To compare epiphytically growing individuals with, especially studies of \textcite{Staeger1908} and \textcite{Loew1892} are quite suitable due to their higher level of detail. For example, \textcite[p. 34]{Staeger1908} already accounted for the absence of epiphytes on conifers and \fsylvatica. They proposed that these tree species occur mainly in \imp{intraspecific} stands and filter too much light for epiphytes to grow. Additionally, \fsylvatica has a very smooth bark hindering leaf litter and humus accumulation. Moreover, \textcite{Staeger1908} pointed out that epiphytes would favor large, single standing trees with accumulated leaf litter. This explanation can be easily assessed, if artificially created systems showing these parameters are examined. Namely, pollard trees like willows usually host a larger number of epiphytes than non pruned trees also including species usually not found as accidental epiphytes \parencite[compare with ][]{Willis1893, Geisenheyner1895, Carriere1977, Bolle1891, Loew1892, Steenis1928, Steenis1925, Jaap1895}.
% Additionally to the work on temperate epiphytes in general, some authors specifically examined the flora on pollard trees like willows usually hosting a larger number of epiphytes than non pruned trees \parencite{Willis1893, Geisenheyner1895, Carriere1977, Bolle1891, Loew1892, Steenis1928, Steenis1925}.

	\crr{\textcite{Ochsner1927} described quite detailed in how far host trees and environmental factors influence the prevalence of non-vascular epiphytes.}
	
	\paragraph{Aims \& Questions}
	In conclusion, this study focuses on following questions: 1. Is the term \emph{accidental epiphytes} still appropriate and what would be an alternative understanding of it? 2. What role do \emph{accidental epiphytes} play in the north-temperate zone? 3. Are there commonly shared epiphytic species and underlying patterns of porophyte specificity also found in related studies? 4. Which factors should furthermore facilitate epiphytic establishment in the north-temperate zone? \imp{Should I already phrase hypotheses here?}
	
	To answer the posed questions and to quantify vascular epiphyte occurrences in the temperate zones, we conducted the first of an annual series of surveys in the Harz Mountains. We chose the Harz Mountains for their humid climate with partly old forests. We tried to represent the tree community of the Harz Mountains so to study a possible host specificity of epiphytes which could then give information on niche demands of temperate epiphytes. For the survey, we randomly selected 34 plots spanning the whole mountain area collecting information on the sites, on all examined trees and on all found epiphytic individuals. The gathered data most prominently contained the tree's species, height, dbh and moss cover as well as the epiphyte's species, size, height, location and generative status. 
	
	\imp{This doesn't really fit here!} \crr{Moreover, this survey compares underlying patterns of common epiphytic species and host specificity with observations by above cited research. The definition of \emph{accidental} is shortly discussed regarding the most commonly found taxa. However, since no individuals on the ground were evaluated, this can neither be integrated into the classification by \textcite{Ibisch1996} nor statistically analyzed like \textcite{Burns2010} did.}
	%For following surveys, geographical data were recorded as well. 
	
	\crr{As there are hardly any obligate or facultative epiphytes in the north-temperate zone, the study of epiphytism is still quite limited for these areas. However, from the above mentioned literature it was frequently recorded that many accidentally epiphytic taxa do exist here. But what is still missing is a comprehensive and thorough \imp{description?} of these accidental epiphytes. This survey aims to lay the foundation to such an undertaking.}
	
%	\crr{As \textcite{Zotz2003} summarized, there is a number of (mostly historical) publications which already mention the existence of epiphytic individuals in the north-temperate zone. Since all of these records are descriptive works, the aim of this study is to \imp{supply?!} quantitative data on a larger scale of epiphytism in these ecosystems. Underlying questions are, how (un-)important epiphytes are in these systems and in how far their occurrences are to be understood as accidental. Based on the reports by \imp{cite the historical source here}, I hypothesized that on the one hand epiphytes play a minor role in the north-temperate zone but that on the other hand the term \textit{accidental} is \imp{unangebracht} and based on wrong assumptions. Furthermore, a study of these temperate epiphytes can aid in understanding of epiphytism itself.}
	
\crr{Both, host tree identity as well as elevation were anticipated to be important factors for} \\
\crr{For each tree a set of parameters was recorded. Moss cover was roughly estimated due to its function as water storage or for soil accumulation. }
\crr{Especially in the lower trunk regions of trees, there was often a transition zone between mosses and soil covered bark. }
	
% MATERIALS & METHODS =================================================================================
\section{Materials \& Methods} \label{sec:MM}
To display the tree community as well as various elevations of the Harz Mountains, the survey nearly stretched above the whole area of the mountains. By that, we focused mostly on the common tree species but included even some rare and recently introduced species to record potential epiphyte load. Since elevation was anticipated to be an important factor  influencing tree structure as well as the potentially epiphytic vegetation, a wide elevation range was examined. However, we focused on higher elevations because the increased humidity was expected to increase the epiphyte load.

	% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	\subsection{Tree Stands}
	In the following, tree stands and plots are used synonymously. For practical reasons and for a certain unlikelihood of epiphytes to occur, trees with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of less than 5 cm were disregarded. Selection of plots followed linear structures such as streets or was tried to match in parking sites. Following that, it was distinguished between streets, forest roads (still drivable with car), dirt tracks (in forest, enlarged for hiking), beaten paths (in forest, small track). For each of the plots, about 50 trees were selected for examination. If trees were on both sides of a plot, about the same number of trees was taken from each. If there were for any reason less than 50 trees, then even noticeably smaller numbers were taken as well. This was done to include small tree stands with rare species as well. Since humidity was expected to be an if not the most important factor to epiphyte viability, the distance of the tree stands to the next river or lake was estimated. For each plot, the type of structure (different path types), number of trees, elevation (m), coordinates were noted.
	
	% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	\subsection{Measured Parameters}
	Following variables were examined for each tree: plot, tree species, dbh (cm), height (m), an estimate of the moss cover (\%), ratio of occupied to empty forks and number as well as species of epiphytes. Noted parameters for examined epiphytes were: tree id, epiphyte species, height in the tree (m), locations on the tree \todo{define classes for locations and substrate} and absence (0) or presence of blossoms (1) or fruits (2). If epiphytes were on the trunk itself, they were noted as such. To distinguish between plants that grow up a trunk from below and use this transition zone as well as plants that are truly epiphytic in higher parts of trees, the height of epiphytes in the trees was estimated. Additionally, photos of each tree with epiphytes and of each epiphyte itself were taken for later identification and to find them again in coming surveys.
	
	% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
	\todo{sum up the used statistical methods and the r-quatsch...}
	
	The map with plots were created using the \textit{ggmap}-package in R by \textcite{Kahle2013} and the map data was extracted from \textcite{GoogleMaps2017}.
	
	In the following, the $\pm$ symbol is used to display the mean $\pm$ the standard deviation.
		
		\paragraph{Multivariate Statistics} \todo{cite multivariate analysis models!}
		To view the epiphyte distribution in dependence of their host trees including environmental factors per tree and plot, ordination methods were applied. For this, mainly the package \textit{vegan} was used \parencite{Oksanen2017}. To determine, if a linear or unimodal model should be applied, a Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was computed. If the axis length of the first axis in the DCA was larger than \imp{1, really?}, unimodal ordination methods were selected. Afterwards the DCA was compared to a Correspondence Analysis (CA) and chosen over the latter, if the Eigenvalue of the second axis was considerably lower (due to the arch effect). This indirect ordination method was furthermore run as a Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) by computing a post-hoc fit for the environmental factors via the \textit{envfit} R~function (included in the \textit{vegan} package). Additionally to the post-hoc fit, a Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA) was computed as a direct ordination method.

% RESULTS =========================================================================================
\section{Results}
In total, 34 tree stands were selected along an elevation range of \mRange{102}{807} and with an average of \mErrRange{406}{139}. The spread of plots was biased to the western side of the Harz Mountains (due to higher elevations) but nearly spread over their whole area. \todo{topographical map of the Harz? including the plots! and weather?}

	\subsection{Tree Stands}
	Even though plots with about 50 trees were preferred, the average plot contained only about 37 trees and the least habited still 17 trees (\autoref{tab:averageplot}). Most of the plots contained between three to nine tree species, with one plot counting 15 species. Epiphytes were found along the whole range of elevation as well as in all plots except for one. On average, there were slightly more epiphytes per plot than trees. However, they showed a much higher variation in the number of individuals (0--122) as well as of species (0--19) within the tree stands. 
	
	\input{tables/summary_wraptable}
	
	% as \textcite{Zotz2009} will know, here the results will appear.
	In total, the survey included 1282 tree individuals from 35 species and 13 families which differed a lot in their abundance (cf. \autoref{tab:alltrees} for a complete list).  Often, tree species showed clustering around a few single plots and solely eight of them occurred in more than 10 plots (\autoref{tab:commontrees}). Most common was \apseudoplatanus, which was found in over \prc{80} of the plots representing \prc{28} of all trees. Frequent were as well \aplatanoides (in \prc{62} of plots and \prc{12} of individuals) and \fexcelsior (\prc{56}, \prc{10}). However, it should be noted that the selection of plots was in no sense representative of the forest structure of the Harz mountains but rather aimed for sites with higher epiphyte abundances.
	
	Of the 35 trees species, 25 had epiphytes on them (= \prc{71}). However, the ten remaining empty tree species made up less than \prc{2} of all trees. In total, epiphytes were found on about \prc{23} of the tree individuals. Most occupied of the tree species was \salba with \prc{76} and an average number of 6 epiphytes per tree (21 \imp{tree} individuals), followed by six other tree species which where occupied in around \prc{40} of the time (5--94 individuals, on average 4--10 epiphytes per tree). The most common tree species had a lower occupation proportion but still around 4--6 epiphytes per individual, like \apseudoplatanus (\prc{24}), \aplatanoides (\prc{34}) and \fexcelsior (\prc{28}). \imp{careful! the mean of epiphytes per trees is not correct, because this includes only occupied trees, not all!}
	
	\input{tables/commontrees}
	
		\paragraph{Acer ssp.}
		..further details here... Besides the two common \textit{Acer} species, seven individuals of \acampestre were found in two plots.
		
		\paragraph{Picea abies} \imp{Shouldn't this all go to the discussion section?} Since especially high stretches of the Harz Mountains on the western side were and are still used for silviculture, conifers are much more common. Specifically, some of these forests are basically monocultures of \pabies. Due to a partial reversal of \imp{something missing here!},  parts of these conifer forests are protected areas such as on the highest mountain of the Harz, namely the \emph{Brocken}. In a prior inspection neither in the economically used nor in the protected forest of \pabies any epiphytes were found. For this reason, only three plots with a high percentage of this tree species were included (in elevations between \mRange{307}{630}). In these, \pabies made up between \pRange{30}{60} of the trees (with about eight other tree species present). And even though nearly \prc{60} of it's individuals occurred, a single individual of \oacetosella at the stem base was the only epiphyte found for \pabies in these three plots. 
		
		\paragraph{Angiospermae vs. Gymnospermae}
		The epiphytic load not only differed between individual tree species, but this can be partially traced back to a clear distinction between Angio- and Gymnosperms. While 296 of the 1282 surveyed trees were occupied with epiphytes (\prc{23}), this ratio was even slightly higher for Angiosperms (\prc{25}, 286 of 1148 occupied) but much lower for Gymnosperm trees (\prc{7}, 10 of 134 occupied).

	% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	\subsection{Epiphytes}  
	\imp{You totally forgot to give the most important information!!} Overall, we found epiphytic individuals of \cmr{xxx} species and \cmr{xxx} genera from \cmr{xxx} families. All of the 15 most important taxa were very common herb genera abundant in the flora of the Harz Mountains like \textit{Geranium}, \textit{Galeopsis }and \textit{Impatiens} (cf. \autoref{tab:commonepis}; cf. \autoref{tab:allepis} for the complete list of taxa). 
	
	\crr{Epiphyte species were  not equally abundant. Some species where quite common while other were only found once or twice. Go into more detail here. Maybe conduct some ecological standard theories of abundances...}
	
	\crr{real epiphytes in this census should be in forks? or way up... However, \pabies does not have forks and neither moss cover.}
	
	\crr{Hard to compare tree species, since the number of individuals is so different. Find a way to correct for that?}
	
	\crr{Location of trees should also determine epiphyte community! Also: Compare the locations if some species are everywhere.}
	
	\crr{Regarding the \textit{accidental} in accidental epiphytes: Some species do have some properties which favor them, which is not just accidental. Moreover, what Gerhard just said: The microhabitat in the forks where epiphytes grow should be the same as on the ground. But since this is just seldom, the quantity of epiphytes is also low.}

		\paragraph{Woody Taxa} Most of the taxa were herbaceous with some exceptions of shrub or even tree species. Most prominent of the latter was \saucuparia with 50 individuals. Its largest individual was \mtr{3.5} in size and its highest in a fork in \mtr{8}. Noteworthy were as well the two abundant \textit{Acer} species of which 43 individuals were found as epiphytes. Furthermore, there were \imp{...} other woody taxa growing epiphytic (namely \spec{Abies}, \cbetulus, \cmonogyna, \fexcelsior, \pabies, \snigra, \uglabra, \vmyrtillus and one unidentified species of the \textit{Pinaceae}.
		
		\input{tables/commonepis}
	
	
		\paragraph{Epiphyte Location}
		We could identify different patterns of epiphyte distribution within the trees (\autoref{fig:heightclasses}). Sorted into four height classes, some trees hosted nearly no epiphytes above \prc{10} of their height (\autoref{fig:heightclasses} E). Only \apseudoplatanus hosted more epiphytes above than below \prc{10} of its height (\autoref{fig:heightclasses} D).
		
		\input{figures/height_classes}
	
		Viewed from the epiphytic perspective, most species grew mainly quite low in the tree at the stem base (\autoref{fig:heightclasses} A). However, some species were more commonly found above \mtr{.5}. One example of these is \saucuparia, of which \prc{90} (n = 50) of the individuals grew between \pRange{10}{50} of the tree's height. Other genera, which were more commonly found between \pRange{10}{50} of the height were \textit{Galeopsis} (\prc{64}, n = 47), \textit{Rubus} (\prc{67}, n = 12) and the species \apseudoplatanus (\prc{67}, n = 6)
		
	% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	\paragraph{Multivariate Statistics}
	In search of underlying patterns of host specificity and the influence of environmental factors, multivariate statistics namely ordination methods were applied to the data set. However, no clear patterns submerged neither in the detrended nor in the canonical correspondence analyses \imp{Add statistics here!}. When the same methods were used for a subset containing only epiphytes above \mtr{0.5},

\section{Discussion}
\pabies -->  However, due to a new forestation approach, the forest structure will change. Deciduous trees like \fsylvatica or the  \textit{Acer} species will benefit from this, which will have an influence on the epiphyte community.

The vertical distribution of the epiphytes behaved accordingly to the findings of \textcite{Zotz2003} at least for the three common species.

	
\imp{Not really true, but maybe you can use something like:} Limitations of this work: Terrestrial plants around trees not examined. Therefore no conclusions  about accidental/facultative epiphytes are possible. However, one can argue that the occuring epiphytic individuals all belong to very common terrestrial species.


\textcite{Zotz2013} reviewed several plant species which are more commonly found as temperate accidental epiphytes.

\imp{Staeger1908 included a list with all found taxa. Compare with your own.} As \textcite[pp.~52]{Staeger1908} compared the epiphytic assemblages in two Swiss Alpine valleys hundred years ago, they found in total 89 accidentally epiphytic plant species. Similarly we counted at least \cmr{xxx} species. However, both of their examined valleys shared only 19 species with each other. And compared to the species found in the Harz mountains, these mostly overlap. This is probably due to the fact that most of these were overall very common terrestrial species. Still, one has to consider that their examination of the epiphytic flora was much like an anecdote compared to this methodological approach. Therefore, 

Already \textcite{Staeger1912} showed that \apseudoplatanus host a rich epiphyte flora and they explain this with its manner to store large quantities of humus, organic matter and moss covers.  \textcite{Staeger1912} even mentioned that they found earthworms in isolated moss cushions at the stem.

\textcite{Jaap1899} already described many useful things: Epiphytes around a lake (due to higher humidity), on pollard willows and \spec{Robinia}, very large epiphytical shrub and tree individuals, that most of epiphytic species have berries which are eaten by birds, fruits adhering to animals, anemochorous fruits, hurling fruits and \textbf{they did a two year examination of the same trees}. That means they already could say which individuals survived (and they say so!). Of all listed species, they only name four for which they could not find a propagation mechanism (namely \cavellana, \qrobur, \rficaria, \gmollugo). In their other article, \textcite{Jaap1895} recall an incident when a harvest wagon accidentally threw or dropped loaded crops onto the neighboring trees. Even though this mode of transportation is outdated, one can imagine that similar incidents are taking place today as well. Then, indeed, one can speak of \textit{accidental epiphytes}. However, this cannot explain the overall number of epiphytic individuals with the present diversity. For some species, though, where a wind or animal born propagation can hardly be assumed, comparable accidental circumstances may apply. For example, his should be applicable to \textit{Quercus} species, since 


Of the nut-bearing trees, many also had epiphytic individuals. Since nuts are too heavy to be dispersed by the wind, probably they were scattered onto trees by their dispersers. Generally, they are dispersed by squirrels, mice and some birds like jays \parencite{VanderWall2001}. In the Harz Mountains these are i.e. \textit{Sciurus~vulgaris}~L. and  \textit{Garrulus~glandarius}~L.. \textcite{Gomez2008} showed, that species of \textit{Sciurus} can be quite effective in dispersing acorns. However, they usually bury the nuts in the ground.
